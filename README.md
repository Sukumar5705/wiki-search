# Wikipedia Search

## Overview
**Wikipedia Search** is a lightweight, single-page web application that allows users to search Wikipedia articles using a keyword.  

The application fetches search results from a **public API** and displays them in a **clean, responsive interface**.  
Built with **HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5**, it features a modern design with syntax highlighting, error handling, and a user-friendly experience.

The application is a **standalone HTML file** with embedded JavaScript and CSS, making it **easy to deploy and share**.  
It uses the **Fetch API** to retrieve search results and dynamically renders them with **links, titles, and descriptions**.

## Features

## Execution Flow

### 1. User Interaction
- The user enters a **keyword** in the search input field (`index.html`) and presses the **Enter** key.  
- Input is validated to ensure it is not empty, preventing unnecessary API calls.  

### 2. API Request
- JavaScript listens for the **"Enter" key event** and triggers the `searchWikipedia` function.  
- The function constructs a request URL:  
```

[https://apis.ccbp.in/wiki-search?search=](https://apis.ccbp.in/wiki-search?search=)<keyword>

````
- A `fetch` request is made to the API using the **GET method**, handled asynchronously with `async/await`.  

### 3. Result Processing
- On successful response, JSON data is parsed to extract `search_results` (titles, links, descriptions).  
- The `displayResults` function clears old results and iterates over new results.  
- Each result is dynamically rendered as a **Bootstrap-styled card** with:  
- Clickable title  
- URL  
- Short description  

### 4. Error Handling and Feedback
- If the search term is **empty**, an error message is shown.  
- If the API request fails or returns no results â†’ display a user-friendly error message.  
- A **loading spinner** is displayed during the API call and hidden once results or errors are processed.
